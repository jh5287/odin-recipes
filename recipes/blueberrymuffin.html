        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are some of the <strong>best</strong> blueberry muffins I have ever made!
            I made them when I was in highschool and I found them online (on a paid website no less)
            and I recently found this recipe again. Make them as big and as moist as you can!
        </p>
